            <p class="col pt-4">We have concluded that from the body heat we produce, we can save electricity and provide it to be the power source for many devices. And if we could save electricity why wouldn't we? We want to make this product for adults or families with high electric bills, and save a few dollars for them. Electric bills are going up and your losing money as you continuously use electricity. Also, sleep is important, but so is time. So, if you were too sleep an average eight hours a night, you could charge and store electricity that is gathered for the span of your sleep. 
            <br>
	Charging phones, and saving electricity isn't the only use for this mattress. This can also be used to be an alternative power source during a power outage, when you can't use your outlets. So, if you need to plug in your lamp or charge your phone, then, you can warm the bed, and just like that you get free electricity.
<br>
Chasing to save money and achieve a more free source of electricity, we aim to design a mattress that gathers electricity and does not need any other forms of electricity to run, but only using the heat that you generate. By having all the layers and parts of a bed included, we added a layer of Peltier tiles in between the memory foam and the sleeping pad. Above the layer of Peltier tiles, is the thin mattress layer that you sleep on, and since the memory foam is below it stays cools, while the other side is heated when you lay on it. We also made sure, that lying on the Peltier tiles will not cause any feelings of discomfort, so we sandwiched them between two cotton sheets, so that they stay in place and prevent any discomfort when laid on.
